                <p>Hi, I'm Dan Shank, a Masters student in the <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/" target="_blank">HCDE Program</a> at the University of Washington.</p>

                <h2>What is your background?</h2>
                <p>
                    Computers have always fascinated me and my interactions with them began mostly with attempts to upgrade them. It continued with an education in computer science and led into work as a quality assurance engineer.
                    It was there that I learned that it was the small stuff that caused the big problems, that it was the details
                    of a feature that most contributed to a user's success with a given task or action. I also learned the
                    importance of understanding the user, of empathizing with their motivations and the context of the tasks that they are trying to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>Why User Experience?</h2>
                <p>
                    As much as I loved the problem solving and detail-oriented aspects of QA, I began to realize that my favorite
                    part of the job was working with interfaces and working with designers and engineers on ways to improve them.
                    That led me naturally toward UX and the ways that I could utilize my talent for identifying patterns and my intuition for quality to
                    design features and interfaces that delight the user and make their lives easier.
                </p>
                <h2>What drives your design?</h2>
                <p>
                    Empathy and a user-centered focus is very important for me as I believe that only by first understanding the users and their motivations and work flows can you design software
                    that fits seamlessly into their lives. I believe that good design exists in the balance between flexibility and simplicity
                    and functions best when it is both useful and usable. I think that good interfaces should be invisible, that they should keep the
                    user's attention on their task, not the process of completing the task.
                </p>
                <h2>What other activities do you enjoy?</h2>
                <p>
                    In my spare time I've developed something of a small-scale woodworking hobby. It's a special feeling to physically shape a piece of raw wood
                    into something that is both beautiful and practical. I also enjoy games in their various electronic and board varieties and love nothing more than a good comfy
                    chair and a book that I can get lost in.
                </p>
