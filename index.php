                <p>Hi, I'm Dan Shank and I believe in the importance of empathy in design.

                <p><b>Tell me about your background</b><br>
                    Well my interest in computers began back in high school with my attempts to rebuild our family's computer into the ultimate gaming machine,
                    an attempt that met with mixed success.  It continued with an education in computer science and led into work as a quality assurance engineer.
                    It was there that I learned that it was the small stuff that caused the big problems, that it was the details
                    of a feature that most contributed to a user's success with a given task or action. I also learned the
                    importance of understanding the user, of empathizing with their motivations and the context of the tasks that they are trying to accomplish.
                </p>
                <p><b>Why User Experience?</b><br>
                    As much as I loved the problem solving and detail-oriented aspects of QA, I began to realize that my favorite
                    part of the job was working with interfaces and working with designers and engineers on ways to improve them.
                    That led me naturally toward UX and the ways that I could utilize my talent for identifying patterns and my intuition for quality to
                    aid in designing features and interfaces that delighted the user and made their lives easier.
                </p>
                <p><b>What drives your design?</b><br>
                    Empathy and a user-centered focus is very important for me as I believe that only by first understanding the users and their motivations and work flows can you design software
                    that fits seamlessly into their lives. I believe that good design exists in the balance between flexibility and simplicity
                    and functions best when it is both useful and usable. I think that good interfaces should be invisable, that they should keep the
                    user's attention on their task, not the process of completing the task.
                </p>
                <p><b>What else do you enjoy?</b><br>
                    As much as I enjoy designing and interacting with software, I've found that there's something special about physically shaping a piece of raw wood
                    into something that is both beautiful and practical. I also enjoy games in their various electronic and board varieties and love nothing more than a good comfy
                    chair and a book that I can get lost in.
                </p>
